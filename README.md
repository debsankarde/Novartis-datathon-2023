    <h1>Daily Sales Problem: Project Summary</h1>
    <h2>1.1. Context</h2>
    <p>
        In our organization, making accurate predictions of future sales is crucial for the finance team. 
        The focus of this challenge, known as the "Daily Sales Problem," is a reflection of a real-world 
        issue that we regularly face. By introducing this challenge to the data science community, 
        we are offering an opportunity to tackle a problem that is of significant importance to us.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our current strategy for sales prediction relies on monthly forecasts. Due to the dynamic nature 
        of our business, we need to examine daily sales patterns more closely. This approach is 
        particularly important for analyzing the performance of specific country-brand combinations, 
        allowing us to predict whether a particular country-brand will perform above or below the 
        expected target.

    <h2>1.2. Daily Sales Phasing</h2>
    <h3>1.2.1. Definition</h3>
    <p>
        Daily Sales Phasing is a crucial metric that assists in evaluating the accuracy of our monthly 
        sales forecasts on a daily basis. It represents the ratio of sales for each working day within a 
        month. Ideally, if an equal amount is sold every working day, the phasings for that month would 
        average around 1/20, assuming a standard work month.
    </p>

    <h3>1.2.2. Importance</h3>
    <p>
        Understanding Daily Sales Phasing is essential because sales distribution is not uniform 
        throughout the month. Shipping and sales patterns can vary significantly between different 
        countries and brands. For example, Country A might show a shipping pattern dependent on 
        weekdays, while Country B's pattern could correlate more with the working date number.
    </p>

    <h2>2. The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this challenge is to develop innovative solutions for accurate prediction and 
        analysis of Daily Sales Phasing, taking into account the unique shipping patterns associated 
        with different countries and brands. By achieving this, we aim to enhance the precision of 
        our sales forecasts and align our business strategies more closely with real-time market 
        dynamics.
